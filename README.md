Description: The game will be begin at the setting of a blackjack table in a casino.
The dealer will ask you a series of questions aboust things like "are you ready to play" and basic questions.
However, no matter what type of answers the player gives, the game will eventually start.
The dealer will then deal deal two cards. It will tell the player the suit and the value of the cards.
Then the player will be asked if they want to "hit" or "stay". Taking a "hit" will give the player another card.
The value of this card will then be added to your previous value, and if the new value is over 21 you bust, which results in a loss.
The game will only end if the player busts. If the player wins, ties, or loses without busting a new set of cards will be dealt.
If the player choses to "stay" no more cards will be dealt to them. If their value is higher than the dealer's the player wins.
If there value is the same as the dealer they will tie. If the value is lower they lose. If the dealer busts, the player wins.
If the dealer's cards give him a value lower than 17 than the dealer is forced to take a hit.

Throughout the creation of this game I received help pretty much from two sources. One my friend from church was a huge help in this
process. He helped me with defining functions which I had a good amount of dificulty with. He also helped me with the issue of the ace.
As you know the value of the ace can either be 1 or 11 in blckjack. He helped show me that I could make it so the ace is counted as
11 unless your value goes over 21, then the ace will count of 1. This helps to put the player in the best position to not bust. I also
recieved help from Damon. Obviously, Damon is excellent with coding and he was very helpful going over my code with me and looking for
spelling or other issues. He also was very helpful with navigating git hub.
